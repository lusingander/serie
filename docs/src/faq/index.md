# FAQ

## Why doesn't the graph display?

Serie displays graphs using specific terminal graphics protocols (such as Kitty and iTerm2 inline images).

**If your terminal emulator doesn't support one of these protocols, Serie will not work — there is no fallback or workaround.**

This is a fundamental requirement, not a limitation that can be worked around.
For a list of supported terminal emulators and compatible environments, see [Compatibility](../getting-started/compatibility.md).

## What are the advantages over other git TUI clients?

Compared to other git TUI clients, Serie offers the following advantages:

- High-quality graph visualization using terminal graphics protocols
- Simple and clean interface

On the other hand, Serie may not be for you if:

- You're satisfied with `git log --graph` or the graph display in existing TUI clients
- You need to perform complex git operations within a TUI client
